DESCRIPTION                                     *vawk*

Work with Awk-friendly columnar data. Provides a simple wrapper to Awk as well
as a few useful functions for chopping and changing columnar data. Requires
Awk to be installed, of course.

COMMANDS                                        *vawk-commands*

All commands accept a range which defaults to the entire file. For commands
which accept columns, these should be comma-separated; you can also use ranges
as a shorthand, e.g. 1,3-6,10,11.

                                                *:Vawk*
:[range]Vawk <script>          Run an arbitrary Awk script.

                                                *:Vcut*
:[range]Vcut <columns>         Delete the columns specified.

                                                *:Vonly*
:[range]Vonly <columns>        Delete all columns except for the specified.

VARIABLES                                       *vawk-variables*

g:vawksep                      The record separator to use for the data.
                               Defaults to Awk's usual whitespace delimiting.
